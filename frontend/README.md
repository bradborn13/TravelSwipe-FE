This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Stack Structure: 
The "T3-Turbo" Stack (The 2026 Industry Standard)
This is currently the most popular way to build a professional-grade React/Node app because it solves the "shared types" problem automatically. It uses tRPC to make your frontend and backend feel like a single piece of code.

Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS.

Backend: Node.js (via Nest.js ).

API Layer: tRPC. This is the "magic" that allows your React components to call backend functions with 100% type safety—no more manual fetch calls or JSON parsing.

Database: PostgreSQL (using Prisma or Drizzle ORM).

Best for: Developers who want the highest quality "Developer Experience" (DX) and want to catch bugs as they type.

Future adaptation to .NET

The 3 Ways to Connect Next.js to .NET
1. The "OpenAPI / Swagger" Path (Most Common)
Instead of tRPC, you use Swagger (which is built into .NET) to "describe" your API. Then, you use a tool on the frontend to turn that description into TypeScript types automatically.

The Workflow: 1. Create your .NET Controller (e.g., UserController.cs). 2. .NET generates a swagger.json file automatically. 3. You use a library like openapi-typescript or hey-api in your React project. 4. Result: You get autocompletion in React for your .NET data, just like tRPC!

2. SignalR (For Real-Time Features)
If your project needs live updates (like a chat app or a live dashboard), .NET has a "superweapon" called SignalR.

It is much more powerful than standard WebSockets. Next.js has great libraries to connect to SignalR hubs, allowing your .NET backend to "push" data directly to your React components.

3. The "Manual" Shared Types Path
If you want to keep it simple and similar to what we discussed earlier:

You keep your shared/types.ts file.

You manually ensure your C# User class matches your TypeScript User interface.

Pro Tip: There are tools like TypeGen for .NET that can look at your C# classes and automatically write the .ts files for your React app.
